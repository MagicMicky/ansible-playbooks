* Our files are UGLY - we have an abundant amount of checks in our installs that doesn't make sense
* This seems overly complicated for what we're trying to achieve

* Detection seem to fail - i have lambdas everywhere
* The themes are not very nice.  color does't really show...
* There's some weird stuff maybe with fzf or autocomplete when i tab it basically doubles my letter and then looks weird (WSL)


ls has no color?

* Maybe an issue about autocomplete and compinit?
