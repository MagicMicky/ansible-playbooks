# Absolute Vanilla Starship Configuration
# Generated by Ansible for {{ machine_profile }} profile
#
# Using Starship's default configuration with NO customization
# to debug character duplication issue in zsh completion.
#
# See STARSHIP.md in dotfiles repo for:
# - Original design goals and removed features
# - Incremental rebuild strategy
# - Testing checklist
#
# Once vanilla works without completion bugs, add features back
# incrementally following the phases in STARSHIP.md

# Empty config = use all Starship defaults
# This gives: directory + git + prompt character (❯) with default colors
